            <h1>  Digital Solution for a private chef</h1>
           <p> This project is centered around Vivian Andersen (ACEN), a 25 year old professional
            gourmet chef based in Copenhagen. The goal is to create a website, the brand identity, the
            social media content, guideline and strategy that are aligned with the client’s values and long
            term goals.
            The website serves the role of a “digital business card” with a minimalistic design, an
            easy navigation system, where customers can have easy access to a portfolio of our client’s
            work, find useful information about the service she provides (menus, prices, social media links,
            must-knows, reviews), and last but not least provide a direct contact link (contact form/
            booking system).
            It is primarily a school exam with specific requirements and a brief allocated time for
            completion, therefore the solution presented is a diamond in the rough.
            The team will be coding the website from scratch in limited time according to the exam
            requirements, but to fit our clients needs and knowledge, e a different version using
            Wordpress, Shopify or Wix would need to be set in place so that she can maintain and update
            herself. </p>
